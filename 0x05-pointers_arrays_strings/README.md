                       0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings Task

1. 0-reset_to_98.c Task:  Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

* Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

2. 1-swap.c Task: Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

* Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b); 

3. 2-strlen.c Task: Write a function that returns the length of a string.

* Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

4. 3-puts.c Task: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

* Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

5. 4-print_rev.c Task: Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

* Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

6. 5-rev_string.c Task: Write a function that reverses a string.

* Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

7. 6-puts2.c Task: Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

* Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

8. 7-puts_half.c Task: Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

* Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
* The function should print the second half of the string
* If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

9. 8-print_array.c Task: Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

* Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
* where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
* Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
* The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
* You are allowed to use printf
