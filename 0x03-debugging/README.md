           0x03. C - Debugging Task

1. 0-main.c, main.h Task: Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

* You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
* You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.

2. 1-main.c Task: Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

* Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
* You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
